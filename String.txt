How we declare string in Javascript?

Syntax:-

var/let/const variable_name="Subho";

In javascript every character of string denoted by a special number,called index.Now,in javascript
String is 0-index based means that first_character in string is in 0-index and the last
character of string is in the (length-1) index.

Example=>

var s="String";

index       character
0               S
1               t
2               r
3               i
4               n
5               g

So,the first index is 0 and the last index is length-1.
